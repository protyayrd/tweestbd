## Technical Implementation

### Cart Logic
- **Automatic Detection**: Cart automatically checks for applicable combo offers
- **Real-time Calculation**: Pricing updates immediately when items are added/removed
- **Category Grouping**: Items are grouped by category to determine eligibility
- **Per-unit Pricing**: Combo price is divided equally among items in the category

### Pricing Calculation
```javascript
// Example: 2 polo shirts at ৳1590 combo price
const perUnitComboPrice = 1590 / 2; // ৳795 each
const originalPrice = 850; // Original price per shirt
const savings = (850 - 795) * 2; // ৳110 total savings
```

### Data Flow
1. Cart items are analyzed by category
2. Available combo offers are fetched for relevant categories
3. Eligibility is checked based on quantity and offer status
4. Discounts are calculated and applied
5. UI is updated with savings information
